# Controlling LED using Push Button

## Overview

Welcome to the **Controlling LED using Push Button** project repository. This project demonstrates a basic electronics application where a push button is used to control an LED connected to a microcontroller.

## Files Included

### 1. LED_with_PushButton.ino

This file contains the Arduino code used to control the LED with a push button. It manages the interaction between the push button and LED states.

## Getting Started

To replicate this project:

1. **Setup**: Connect the components as follows:
   - Connect one leg of the push button to ground.
   - Connect the other leg of the push button to digital pin 2 on the microcontroller.
   - Connect one end of a resistor to digital pin 7 (or your chosen pin for the LED).
   - Connect the other end of the resistor to the anode (longer leg) of the LED.
   - Connect the cathode (shorter leg) of the LED to ground.

2. **Upload Code**: Use the Arduino IDE or similar software to upload the `LED_with_PushButton.ino` code to your microcontroller.

## Running the Code

After uploading the code to your microcontroller, the setup allows you to control the LED with the push button as follows:

- Press the push button to turn on the LED.
- Release the push button to turn off the LED.

Ensure that your connections are secure and correct before powering on your microcontroller.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you will successfully set up and operate an LED using a push button with your microcontroller. This project serves as an introductory exercise to basic electronics and programming concepts.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your learning and experimentation goals. Happy coding!
